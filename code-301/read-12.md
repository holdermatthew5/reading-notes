Based on the video and reading it looks like partials are really easy. The following code could would be placed where you want to use the partial:
- `<%= include('filepath to partial') %>`

Before that you only need to add the partial to the file structure. To do that you make a file with a name ending in `.ejs`, such as `partial.ejs`. Inside that file write up any html you please including any ejs templating.

I'd love to take more notes than this, but there isn't really anything else I can think to write.
