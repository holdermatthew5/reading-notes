I was definitely over complicating the idea of sending data from frontend via get request. I assumed it was more than just using a form with name attributes for the key and value attributes for it's value. With this I could easily get through feature 2 of lab 12. I'd only have to reference request.query or for a post request I could use request.body. Those would have an object containing properties where the keys are the value of the name attribute and the values are the value of the value attribute. This was honestly some primo timing as far as the note_app lecture, lab and reading go (I started lab-12 feature 2 today before the reading). Having them in that order helped everything come together perfectly in my head. It's the total opposite of the try learn try again format we've been using and it worked perfectly which is interesting. Maybe learning well isn't about finding the perfect tool and understanding how it works and why it helps, but instead about finding the right tool at the right time and understanding the same (that could complicate the training part lol).
