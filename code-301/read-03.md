- mustache is a library for html.
- mustache.js is the same thing but in a js file.
- `mustache.render('hello', {{name}}", { name: "Sherlynn" });` looks for the key name in the object to the right and returns Hello, Sherlynn.
- template + input data = output
  - tmplate - mustach

- css display rule defines a flex container.
- order controls the order because they're laid out in source order (i'm assuming source means source code).
- css flex-direction changes whether elements lay left to right (row), right to left (row-reverse), top to bottom (column), or bottom to top (column reverse).
- flex-grow lets things take a specific number times what they would normally take of empty space from parent element
- flex-wrap lets things take more than one line
  - nowrap - doesn't wrap
  - wrap - wraps top to bottom
  - wrap-reverse - wraps bottom to top
